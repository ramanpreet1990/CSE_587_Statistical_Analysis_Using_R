Introduction and Context
------------------------------------
Data Science process involves a phase where preliminary understanding of the data is explored. This phase is commonly known as [**Exploratory Data Analysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) (EDA) and is a very useful phase before launching onto a full scale [**big-data analytics**](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/B/big_data_analytics.html) that often requires extensive infrastructure support and complex or newer algorithms such as [**Hadoop MapReduce**](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html) and [**Apache Spark**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark) on large clusters. 

The algorithms and methods we will use in our EDA are also highly applicable and useful to perform (run) statistical analysis on commonly available public data sets and on the outputs of big-data processing. 

EDA is perfect complement to big-data analytics that offers a systematic approach to choosing among the many possible outcomes of big-data analytics and will help us gain intuition about the data in the early phases. EDA begins with understanding the schema of the data (head) and ends with an approximate [**statistical model**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model) representing the data.
